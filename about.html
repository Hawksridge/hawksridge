                    <h2>Hello, I'm Matt</h2>
                    <p>
                        Photography found me the way most meaningful things do—by accident. I picked up my first camera on a trip to Iceland in 2015, intending only to document the northern lights for friends back home. What I discovered instead was a new way of seeing the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, the camera has become my constant travel companion. I'm drawn to the interplay of light and shadow, the geometry of cities, and the unguarded moments that reveal something true about a place or person. My work sits somewhere between documentary and fine art—I want my images to feel both immediate and timeless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not behind the lens, you'll find me researching my next destination, getting lost in local markets, or hunting for the perfect bowl of ramen. I believe travel is best done slowly, with room for wrong turns and unexpected conversations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site is a collection of moments I've been fortunate enough to witness—places that moved me, hotels worth remembering, and stories from the road. I hope they inspire you to explore.
                    </p>
