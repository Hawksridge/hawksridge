                            An urban sanctuary that masterfully blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with contemporary luxury. The rooms offer breathtaking views of the Imperial Palace gardens, and the spa rivals anything I've experienced in Bali. The attention to detail here is extraordinary—from the washi paper screens to the cypress wood soaking tubs. Worth every yen.

                            Perched on a cliff in Ravello, this 11th-century palazzo offers what might be the most stunning infinity pool in the world. The views of the Mediterranean are intoxicating at any hour, but sunset from the terrace is genuinely life-changing. The staff remembered my coffee order from the first morning. This is what hospitality looks like.

                            A car-free private island between Corsica and Sardinia that time forgot. The accommodations are charming rather than luxurious, but the turquoise waters and pristine beaches more than compensate. Breakfast on the pier watching fishing boats is the definition of Mediterranean living. Loses a star for inconsistent service, but the setting is magical.

The surf breaks are legendary, but even non-surfers will find something spiritual about this place. Horseback rides along empty beaches at sunset, traditional villages untouched by tourism, and a sense of adventure that luxury resorts rarely achieve.

                        <p class="travelogue-location">Kyoto & Nara, Japan</p>
                        <div class="travelogue-excerpt">
                            <p>
                                I came to Kyoto expecting the postcard version—geishas in Gion, the golden pavilion, selfie sticks at the bamboo grove. What I found instead was something quieter, earned through predawn walks and wrong turns down unmarked paths.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The real Kyoto reveals itself at 5 AM, when monks sweep stone gardens in meditation, when the only sound is bamboo clacking in the wind. At Daitoku-ji temple complex, I spent an entire morning in a subtemple called Koto-in, watching light move across a moss garden. No other visitors came. The head priest brought me tea without a word.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was in these moments—not at the famous sites—that I understood why people devote lifetimes to this city. The autumn maples were spectacular, yes, but what stays with me is the particular quality of silence in those hidden gardens, the sense that attention itself is a form of prayer.

                                The Patagonian wind doesn't whisper—it screams. On my third day on the W Trek, gusts knocked me to my knees twice before noon. My carefully planned itinerary became meaningless; out here, the weather decides everything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But then: a break in the clouds over the Torres themselves, those three granite towers that seem impossibly vertical, impossibly ancient. I sat on cold stone for two hours, watching light and shadow play across rock that has stood for 12 million years. My problems, even my presence, felt cosmically insignificant—and somehow that was the most comforting feeling I've had in years.
                            </p>

                                The refugios along the trail were full of people from everywhere, all of us temporarily freed from our regular lives. A doctor from Seoul, a teacher from São Paulo, a retired couple from Cornwall walking the trail for their 40th anniversary. We shared mate tea and stories in five languages.

                                "You are lost," the boy said, not as a question. I was standing at the intersection of four identical alleyways in the Fes medina, the largest car-free urban area on Earth, a maze of 9,000 streets that has swallowed travelers for a thousand years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He led me through the tanneries—the smell is as famous as it is deserved—past coppersmiths whose hammers rang out medieval rhythms, through a door that opened into a hidden riad where his grandmother served mint tea so sweet it made my teeth ache. This is how Fes works: you surrender to being lost, and the city rewards you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, in the Atlas Mountains, I stayed with a Berber family in a village accessible only by mule. No WiFi, no electricity after 9 PM. The stars that night were violent, overwhelming. I realized I'd forgotten what actual darkness looks like. The world felt very old and very young at once.

                                At 2 AM on the summer solstice, I stood on a beach in Lofoten watching the sun hover stubbornly above the horizon, painting the mountains in shades of gold and rose. There were others there—photographers, mostly, but also families with children who should have been in bed hours ago. Nobody wanted to miss it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The midnight sun does strange things to your sense of time. Meals become suggestions. Sleep feels like an inconvenience. I found myself eating dinner at midnight and hiking at 3 AM, my body clock completely untethered. The locals seemed amused by my disorientation—they've had millennia to adjust.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fjords themselves beggar description. You think you understand scale until you're in a small boat beneath cliffs that rise half a mile straight up, waterfalls threading down like silver hair. I took hundreds of photographs. None of them capture it. Some places exist beyond the frame.

                                Bhutan measures its success by Gross National Happiness rather than GDP, and after two weeks there, the concept doesn't seem naive—it seems revolutionary. This is a country where television wasn't introduced until 1999, where plastic bags are banned, where architecture is governed by national decree to preserve traditional styles.

                                The climb to Tiger's Nest monastery—Taktsang, properly—is the defining image of Bhutan: prayer flags snapping in the wind, incense curling from shrines, the seemingly impossible temple complex clinging to a sheer cliff 3,000 feet above the valley floor. A monk blessed me at the top, pressing his forehead to mine. I'm not religious, but I felt something.

                                What struck me most was the pace. Nobody rushed. Shopkeepers closed for lunch without apology. My guide, Tshering, seemed genuinely puzzled when I asked about Bhutan's economic development goals. "We have enough," he said. "What more do we need?" I'm still thinking about that question.
